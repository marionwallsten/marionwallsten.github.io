                            During my second year at Uppsala University, I was responsible for updating,
                            maintaining and launching the student union's mobile application for new students, which was
                            built in React Native and used Firebase. The app was launched on both IOS and Android.
                            The information on the app was tailored depending on what program the new student's belonged
                            to. They could see their schedule, who was that particular programs closest contact,
                            book tickets to events, aside from general information about the reception.
                            A part from the app, I was also responsible for the website that acted as an alternative to
                            the application. The application had about 1000 daily users during the reception.
                            Before this project I had never worked with mobile applications, and only knew some basics
                            in web development. This project took 400+ hours, distributed on several weekly meetings,
                            planning,
                            coding, and preperations for the reception. It spanned over six months and was done while
                            being a full time student!

                            I am currently studying computer science at Uppsala University. I have worked in different
                            kinds of groups, as well as indivdually on projects and assignments. Two examples of
                            projects has been garbage collection in C and a disease spreading simulator in Go. I have
                            learnt working according to agile methodology, using kanban and scrum.
                            Courses have also focused on
                            algorithms
                            and data

                            programming. But I have also studied courses in project management in software
                            engineering, software
                            design in large projects, databases, system
