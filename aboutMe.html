                <div class="aboutMeText">
                    Hi! I’m Marion Wallsten, and I am about to finish my Bachelor’s in Computer
                    Science at Uppsala University!
                </div>
                <div class="aboutMeText">
                    I have since I grew up always found problem solving very enjoyable. When I was younger I loved
                    playing puzzle video games, and it is still one of my favourite spare time activities. This interest
                    has today translated to working on programming problems, which, for me, is kind of like a puzzle
                    game! Technology has also always been an interest of mine, and I am always excited about learning
                    about new technology, on my own, or as part of a team learning from others. I always want to evolve
                    to be a better problem solver, programmer and person!
                </div>
                <div class="aboutMeText">
                    I am not afraid of working on different kinds of problems on my own, but I have learnt
                    the value of teamwork, and the advantages of working together as a team after doing a lot of group
                    projects in school, and also from working in the service industry. I aim to always deliver
                    the best version of myself and my work, to grow, and at the same time contribute to other people
                    growing and evolving too.
