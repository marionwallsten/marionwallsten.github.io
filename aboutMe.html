                <div class="aboutMeText">
                    Hi! I’m Marion Wallsten, and I am about to finish my Bachelor’s in Computer
                    Science at Uppsala University!
                </div>
                <div class="aboutMeText">
                    Before I started studying in Uppsala, I lived in London for 6 months working in retail, and I also
                    studied at Santa Monica College for a year. I love learning about, and experience different
                    cultures!
                </div>
                <div class="aboutMeText">
                    During my time at Uppsala University, I have been engaged with the Engineering and Science Students’
                    union, and have had different positions throughout the years. During my second year I was
                    responsible
                    for maintaining and updating the app and website for the reception of engineering and science
                    students’,
                    as well as making their first two weeks at the university memorable by being active in different
                    activities.

                <div class="aboutMeText">
                    In the spring of 2022 I was responsible for updating the website, as well as maintaining the
                    registration system for the teams that participated in the River Rafting event that is held each
                    year in Uppsala!

                <div class="aboutMeText">
                    In my spare time I really enjoy playing co-op puzzle video games, especially if it's scary! I have a
                    big passion for music
                    and love making playlists for different kind of occasions. Here on the left you can play one of my
                    favourite playlists!
