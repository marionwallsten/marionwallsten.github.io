            <h1>About me</h1>

            <div class="aboutMe">
                <div class="aboutMeText">
                    Hi! I’m Marion Wallsten, and I am about to finish my Bachelor’s in Computer
                    Science at Uppsala University!
                </div>
                <div class="aboutMeText">
                    I have since I grew up always found problem solving very enjoyable. When I was younger I loved
                    playing puzzle video games, and it is still one of my favourite spare time activities. This interest
                    has today translated to working on programming problems, which, for me, is kind of like a puzzle
                    game. Technology has always been an interest of mine, and I am curious about learning new ways of
                    problem solving by myself, as well as learning from others. I want to always evolve to be a better
                    problem solver, programmer and person!
                </div>
                <div class="aboutMeText">
                    I am not afraid of working on different kinds of problems on my own, but I have previously worked
                    several jobs in the service industry, and have learnt the value of teamwork, and the advantages of
                    working together as a team. I aim to always deliver the best version of myself and my work, to grow,
                    and at the same time contribute to other people growing and evolving too!
                </div>
                <div class="aboutMeText">
                    From long roadtrips with my dad listening to Fast Car by Tracy Chapman, my mother playing her
                    favourite songs on our stereo in the kitchen and my sister showing me the newest releases, my
                    passion for music has always been great. I have realised how much music can make a difference on
                    feelings, situations and connections, and to be a part of how millions of people listen to music
                    every day would be an amazing experience for me.
